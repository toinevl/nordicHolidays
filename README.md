## Architecture Overview

- **Frontend:** Vite + TypeScript static app deployed to Azure Static Web Apps (Free tier)
- **API:** Azure Functions v4 TypeScript on Flex Consumption at `https://sweden-travel-api.azurewebsites.net`
- **Storage:** Azure Table Storage — `Itineraries` and `Preferences` tables (`partitionKey="owner"`)
- **AI:** Anthropic Claude via server-side `POST /api/generate` with forced tool use for structured output

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for the full topology diagram, repository structure, and data-flow walkthroughs.

## Storage

SwedenTravel uses **Azure Table Storage** exclusively for persistence. It stores `Itineraries`, `Preferences`, and `Profiles` tables under a unified `owner` model.

![Storage architecture](docs/storage-architecture.excalidraw)

Open `docs/storage-architecture.excalidraw` in [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com) to edit/view the diagram.

### Owner model

Every row is keyed by `ownerId`. Two identities are supported:

- **Guest** — transient `owner-<uuid>` generated at startup and persisted in `localStorage` under `ownerId`
- **Entra signed-in user** — stable `entra-<sub>` derived from the Microsoft identity `sub` claim

Anonymous trip generation (`POST /api/generate`) remains open. Saved trips and preferences require a valid `ownerId`.

### Tables

| Table | Partition key | Row key | Notes |
|------|--------------|---------|-------|
| `Itineraries` | `owner` | `ownerId` | Saved/generated trip details |
| `Preferences` | `owner` | `ownerId` | UI prefs and feature flags |
| `Profiles` | `profile` | `ownerId` | Display name, email, created/updated timestamps, extensible JSON extensions |

### Local state

- `localStorage` keys: `ownerId`, `swedentravel_profile`
- MSAL token cache: browser `localStorage` for the SPA session
- Refresh tokens are held in-memory/OS chrome storage only, never persisted server-side

## Deploy

Two independent GitHub Actions workflows trigger on pushes to `main` with path filters so only the changed component redeploys.

| Workflow | File | Deploys |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend | `.github/workflows/deploy-frontend.yml` | Azure Static Web Apps |
| API | `.github/workflows/deploy-api.yml` | Azure Functions (Flex Consumption) |

**Required secrets** (set in GitHub repository settings):

| Secret | Used by |
|---|---|
| `AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN` | deploy-frontend.yml |
| `AZURE_FUNCTIONAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE` | deploy-api.yml |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | API runtime (set in Function App config) |
| `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING` | API runtime (set in Function App config) |
